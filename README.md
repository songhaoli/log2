# log2
BBP for log(2)

    This program implements the BBP/Spigot algorithm to generate a few binary
    digits of log(2), or in general log(n)-log(n-1), beginning immediately after a given position id, or in other words
    beginning at position id + 1.
    This is a simplified version of the same alogrithm for pi.
